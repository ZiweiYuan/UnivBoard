                "description": "The Engineering Management and Leadership Program is specifically designed for those engineers or computer scientists who wish to reach their career goals by expanding their business acumen while also advancing their technical knowledge. Unlike an MBA, the Master of Science Program in Engineering Management and Leadership couples technical proficiency with business comprehension, providing the optimum skill set for a wide variety of management positions from technical product manager to chief technology officer. This is a program for professionals who must balance technical capability and business understanding in the development of products and processes that have a high technological content. Our program is for those professionals who want to be valued contributors in both technical and business arenas, and who wish to sustain their technical vitality while advancing their careers.",
                "requirements": "A minimum of 45 quarter units are required for the master's degree. For the Engineering Management and Leadership degree, 20 units must be completed in engineering management courses, 19 units in technical courses and 6 units in The SCU Graduate Core. Technical courses include courses in civil, computer, electrical, or mechanical engineering; or applied mathematics; or a combination of all these. Please refer to the current Graduate Bulletin for more information relating to technical courses applicable to this degree.",
                "admission": "Admission to the Engineering Management and Leadership Program is open only to those who hold an undergraduate degree or graduate degree in engineering or computer science. The undergraduate program must be from a four-year accredited engineering program substantially equivalent to Santa Clara's. Work experience is preferred, but not required.",
