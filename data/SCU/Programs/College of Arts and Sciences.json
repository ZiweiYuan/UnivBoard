Students learn how individual neurons produce and process electrochemical signals required for cellular communication (cellular and molecular neuroscience). Students study neural circuits that process sensory information from the environment and produce motor behavior and other adaptive output (systems neuroscience). Students study thought, emotion, and behavior by looking at the structure and function of brains in normal and diseased states (behavioral and cognitive neuroscience).

This practical discipline provides insights into important issues such as the determinants of wealth and poverty; unemployment, inflation, international trade, and economic growth; and success and failure in the marketplace. The rigorous, systematic analysis that the study of economics brings to bear on these and other real-world issues provides excellent preparation for careers in both the private and the public sectors, as well as for graduate study in economics, business, public policy, and law. Economics graduates pursue varied careers in business, law, banking and finance, government service, education, and private consulting. Students considering graduate study in economics leading to a master&aposs or doctoral degree are strongly encouraged to meet with their advisor as early as possible to plan an appropriate course of study.",

        "description": "The Department of Biology offers a program leading to the bachelor of science degree. The major provides students a solid foundation in the core concepts of modern biological thought, and provides students with critical skills to put concepts into practice. The biology major serves as a strong foundation for graduate, medical, or professional studies, as well as for careers in teaching, research, and business. Most courses emphasize laboratory or field work, and students are also encouraged to work with faculty on research projects. Most faculty members involve students in their research programs. Qualified students can obtain course credit for research by enrolling in BIOL 195, and for major research projects by enrolling in BIOL 198. Minor degrees in biology and related disciplines (biotechnology, biomedical engineering, public health, and environmental studies) are available. The Biology Department also offers the fundamental introductory curriculum for all of life science majors, as well as courses that satisfy the Natural Science and Science, Technology & Society requirements of the Core Curriculum, the latter of which are available to all University students who are curious about the nature of life. Numerous study abroad opportunities in the life sciences, both for biology majors and nonmajors, are available through the Study Abroad office.",
