                "description": "World War II stands as one of the most explosive moments in U.S. and global history in the 20th century because of the myriad ways the conflict influenced the postwar world. The United States emerged from the war as the premiere global superpower in terms of combined military, diplomatic, and financial supremacy. However, the United States found itself under increased scrutiny due to its history and maintenance of structural or institutionalized racism. In the midst of military and ideological conflict against the Nazi regime in Germany, and addressing the claims of civil rights and anti-colonial activists, the United States became a composite site of the tensions that defined a democratic society struggling with ongoing racism. This reading seminar explores these tensions, which were exacerbated by the rise of anti-racist perspectives in the anthropological and biological sciences just preceding the war. The assigned readings and discussions engage these phenomena in order to properly explore the significance of \"race\" in the World War II era. Also listed as HIST 178. (5 units)",

And in doing so, transformed the notion of the artist from that of mere craftsman to superstar.

Environmental justice as a principle affirms the right of all people to healthy livable communities. Environmental injustice occurs when environmental benefits and burdens are unevenly distributed along the lines of identity, including race, class, and/or nationality. Food justice research addresses inequalities in food access and studies the patterns, causes, and solutions associated with increasing hunger and obesity among eaters and the accumulation of environmental costs in agricultural landscapes. After reviewing several seminal studies in environmental and food justice, this class delves into case studies in California and Central America. Learners will conduct a major research project, participate in team-based collaborations, and engage local communities as part of this course. Prerequisite: ENVS 22 or 79. (5 units)",

However, both stopped short of the most radical realization of the promises of the age of Enlightenment, particularly with regard to slavery and the racial discrimination that went along with it. The slave revolt on Saint-Domingue and the Haitian revolution, by contrast, witnessed the fullest realization of these promises in the form of the only successful slave revolt in human history. The events on Hispaniola took place at the nexus of world historical forces of globalization through commerce, cross-cultural encounter, racial mixing, and the dispersal of radical Enlightenment ideas and their realization in the form of revolution. As a result of the powerful currents of human history that flowed through the region, the Haitian revolution has proved to be an enduring source of both fear and creativity in the history of race relations, slavery, and abolition, and the forging of a new world identity for the descendants of the once enslaved populations of the island. This course will examine the history of the revolutionary years in Haiti, its near erasure from Western historical memory, and the literary and historical recovery of its importance in the 20th and 21st centuries.

What forces propel individuals to assist or resist modern war making?

                "description": "This class will introduce students to the Quranic discourse in English translation as a literary product of 7th century Arabia. No prior knowledge of Arabic or Quran is required, though it is encouraged. The Quran is the sacred scripture of 2 billion Muslims, or 1 in 4 people in the world, and by 2030 it is estimated that 1 in 3 people will be Muslim. Yet, few Americans have ever read the Quran and even fewer understand its literary significance. This class looks at the Quran within its historical context, first as an aural experience, and second as a written scripture unfolding over the course over the 23-year mission of the Prophet Muhammad. For 1,400 years, the Quran has served as the gold standard of the Arabic language and the pinnacle of Arabic literary and linguistic achievement. Course is taught in English. Prerequisite: None.

In this course, we will investigate Italy as a syncretic melting pot for ancient, medieval, early modern, and contemporary ideas and practices from the Mediterranean and beyond; and as a productive cultural site responsible for, itself, shaping ideas and practices in Europe, the \"New World,\" and beyond to the present day. In the first of this two-course sequence, we will focus on: (1) Medieval Italy as an important locus of syncretism with an emphasis on the Mediterranean and the movement of political, culinary, and cultural ideas from east to west and south to north; and (2) Renaissance Italy, the primary features of the Italian Renaissance and its artistic, cultural, and scientific influence on Western culture. During the second quarter, we will extend our examination of syncretism to 19th-century Italy, a country struggling with a definition of incomplete nationhood even beyond Unification in 1861. Finally, we will explore how 20th and 21st century Italy, through its changing political role, difficult marriage with the Church, and waves of migrations (specifically emigration to the United States, and recent immigration to Italy) has returned to question its relationship to global culture. Course is taught in English and therefore does not satisfy the Core second language requirement. (4 units each quarter)",

But, what if Jesus was black, non-white Latino/a, Amerindian, Asian, or Jewish? And, why is contemporary scholarship still grappling with the idea of Jewish messiah? In order to map the politics of interpretation and presentation, the course seeks to \"radicalize\" Jesus by (1) exploring his Jewishness in terms of race and ethnicity; (2) critically engaging sources from the New Testament, Apocryphal narratives, Rabbinic literature, and the Quran; (3) interrogation of the racial/racist reconstructions of Western biblical scholarship; and (4) mapping the implications for marginalized ethnic communities and interracial dialogue. Key themes to explore include: Race/ethnicity, Colonialism and Imperialism, the quests for Historical Jesus, Hitler&aposs Third Reich, Eugenics, Interreligious Dialogue, police violence (Ferguson & Baltimore), and the polemic over Jesus&apos wife.

                "title": "Religion and Medicine in Healthcare",
                "description": "The history of the institutions of medicine and religion have long been intertwined in healthcare. In the early 20th century, the institution of biomedicine became dominant, thus rendering religious approaches as quackery. Yet, religion-based approaches to healing resurged in the late 20th century due to the decline of medical authority and a convergence of the women&aposs health movement, alternative spirituality, and patient&aposs rights activism. From the 1970s to the 2000s, religion-based forms of healing moved from being considered \"alternative\" to \"integrative\" medicine by the medical establishment. In this course, we will utilize critical perspectives to understand and assess the changing landscape of healthcare in relation to the institutions of religion and medicine with special attention to patient experiences and institutional authority.
