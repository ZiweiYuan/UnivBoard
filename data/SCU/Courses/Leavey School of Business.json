Nationally renowned business, military, and civic leaders share the experiences and challenges that shaped them, their careers, and major decisions. The goal of having iconic leaders share with honesty and vulnerability is to inspire students to do the same in the course and their lives. Harvard Business School cases give students the opportunity to learn from the most critical business and policy decisions of our times. Putting students in the role of decision-maker challenges them to understand the complexity of decision making and leadership, and begins to train them for their careers post SCU. Leadership Development Teams (LDTs) are small mentored groups. The goal is for students to explore and share their authentic selves and develop the courage to live as their authentic selves in their careers and lives.

As such, they help firms engage the creativity and problem solving skills of firm-hosted online communities of users, employees, and other experts in the creation, development and refinement of products or services.

Yet many Silicon Valley marketers rely only on technology, attributes and/or price and overlook the strategic and tactical benefits that a well-managed brand provides. Achieving Brand Leadership provides a framework and tools for marketers to successfully brand products and services and add an additional layer of advantage with in the competitive environment. The course defines and examines the concept of branding through a theoretical and conceptual framework and in number of business contexts. Beginning with a fundamental review of the core branding elements, we weigh the importance of both the promise and the experience aspects of branding in building and sustaining trust. An examination of brand measurements illuminates the power of metrics and highlights different aspects of branding strategies. A look at past cases of successful and unsuccessful branding brings out variations in approaches to such issues as master brands, sub-brands, and the branding of services. Finally, the impact of branding architectures and creative positioning on brand equity are considered. The course will use both management readings and current articles to provide a solid foundation for analysis. A series of cases drawn from both the product and service arenas will enable students to apply this analytical framework to actual situations. Brand equity and its related metrics provide a standard basis in evaluating various strategies for establishing and growing brands. A final individual course project offers an opportunity to integrate various facets of branding for a specific product or service. Prerequisite: MKTG 3552. (2 units)",

                "description": "These course prepare students for the career transitions that they will encounter once completing Santa Clara University&aposs MBA program. These highly relevant courses concentrate on the skills students require to succeed early on in their careers. These lessons learned will be applicable to transitions throughout the students&apos careers. The courses are based on critical transitions, formative experiences, and personal conflict that characterize the common challenges MBAs are likely to face as they progress in their careers. One objective is to help students gain a more robust understanding of some of the pitfalls they may encounter as they make transitions within or across organizations. Research demonstrates that career failures are often associated with individual failures to successfully make these transitions. Blending theory and practice sessions will illustrate the lessons learned by others (such as SV executives) that have sometimes stumbled in making what seem to be straightforward transitions. Why are transitions challenging? Typically transitions require learning new skills and strategies for managing people who have different responsibilities, needs, goals and expectations than the individual has led in the past. For example, the role as individual team member vs. managing a team requires a shift in mindset from getting a job done through personal skills and effort to getting work done through others; shifting from a manager to a leader requires a shift in attention from focusing on doing things right to doing the right things. Such transitions often mean letting go of the very things that have made us successful in the past and deriving satisfaction from others&apos accomplishments. Although easy to understand conceptually, this marks a fundamental shift in individuals&apos identities. Prerequisite: All core courses. Must be taken in last quarter of residence. (1 unit)",
