Four weeks of the course will involve reading and discussing scholarship about the Court Ce.g, the certiorari process, the selection of Justices, and how the Court decides cases. Ten weeks of the course will be devoted to the oral argument and decision of cases on the Court's current docket. At each such class meeting, some students will act as attorneys in the case and present oral arguments. The remaining students will act as justices, questioning the attorneys during argument and then meeting in conference to decide the case. For each case, at least two students will write opinions, which will subsequently be circulated, to the entire class for discussion. By the end of the semester, each student will argue at least one case and write two opinions. For these ten class meetings, every student will be required to read the actual briefs that have been filed with the Supreme Court, as well as some of the important precedent cases. Consequently, this course requires more reading than the average law school class. In addition, students' written opinions will be reviewed and discussed by their peers. Students uncomfortable with either of these aspects of the class should consider other courses. Grading will be based on in order of importanceCstudents' written opinions, their oral arguments, and their general class participation. Prerequisite: 200 Constitutional Law I.",

                "description": "The Seminar will provide both an overview of the problems faced by the indigent and subordinated as well as offering an opportunity to enhance the lawyering skills you will need to assist clients in the future. The class will also discuss the public interest problems confronting low income, multi-ethnic communities, including the availability of legal services (or the lack thereof). Throughout the semester, we will look at a variety of approaches to dealing with these public interest law problems including litigation, legislative, administrative, media work, community organizing and coalition building. The Seminar will also offer some introductory training in lawyering skills including interviewing, counseling and theory development. As part of the Seminar, each student will complete a written project trying to develop creative strategies for dealing with some problem area involving public interest law. We encourage students to work in pairs on these projects. Potential project areas might include child abuse, civil rights, consumer law, domestic violence, education law, elderly law, employment law, homelessness, housing, human rights, immigration law, and juvenile rights. These projects can fulfill the Supervised Analytical Writing Requirement. There is no final examination for this course, rather the class will be graded based on your Seminar participation and your presentation and written project. ",

A new concept has emerged in this period-globalization-which some argue is an accurate way to describe the massive changes underway in the international economy. Others disagree, arguing that the more things change the more they remain the same-that today's issues among nations continue to reflect longstanding differences. The debate is not simply academic but goes to the heart of policy choices being made by millions of people in every region of the globe. The questions raised by globalization are particularly acute for those countries attempting to break away from older state-centered patterns of political and economic organization. From the former Yugoslavia and the former Soviet Union to many of the developing countries of Latin America, the Middle East and Asia efforts are underway to support new ways of doing business that look, on the surface at least, like American-style capitalism. But the legal institutions necessary to make this effort a success are, as yet, immature and underdeveloped. The risks and uncertainties that this process entails are complicated but represent an exciting challenge for legal scholars and policy makers. This seminar will discuss the major points of view in the globalization debate and explore the role that law plays in solving the problems raised by the new era. Each semester we concentrate on one particular issue- set of significance, such as corporate governance or international labor issues.Students will read both theory and examine case studies.

Awareness of their options will help students to make informed decisions about their future law school course selections and continuing education after graduation in this field of study.
