We are ideal for working adults.  The degree program can be taken fully online, fully on-campus, or a combination of the two. These options give you the freedom to fit into your life a graduate degree while keeping your other commitments. The MFA in Creative Writing at Mount Saint Mary's, Los Angeles will be synonymous with the latest in technology and teaching.  In addition, you'll be able to study in Spanish as well as English.  Starting Fall 2016, we plan to phase in bilingual study.  Beginning now, students may write their thesis projects in either language.\nWhat gives our program its special character?  We develop writers in multiple genres, believing that you can excel in more than one.   We are interested in the whole writer, an expert who isn't narrow.  Our integration of the humanities into our course of study reflects commitment to intellectual rigor and liberal arts as the cornerstone of human understanding.  We pay close attention to your needs as a developing artist.  The courses are demanding, disciplined, and the level is high.  In short, we give you your money's worth.\nThe teachers in our program put a premium on helping our students into their professional careers, through continued mentoring.  This means not only teaching the techniques that make you the best writer you can be, but also preparing you for the publication market.  Our writers and director, combined, have a long track record of helping students to national and international literary prizes and book-length publications.  Whatever your career path, our job is to help you write stories, novels, plays, poems, or screenplays, at the highest level, and get them into print or staged before an appreciative public.  In that, we are practical minded and the curriculum is set up to get you there.",

This program prepares teachers to work with students in middle and high school classrooms in California. Students begin the program with prerequisite courses in foundational areas such as development, culture, and language acquisition. In the three professional preparation courses students work with Content Area Coaches who are exemplary classroom teachers. This experience includes fieldwork in the Content Area Coaches’ secondary classrooms. Students finish the program with supervised teaching and a culminating seminar. Supervised teaching may be completed in the student’s own classroom (intern or private school teachers) or in exemplary teachers’ classrooms in Mount Saint Mary’s University associated schools (undergraduates and pre-service graduate students). Coursework and fieldwork provide the essential knowledge and skills students need to pass the California Teacher Performance Assessment.  Additional requirements for a teaching credential include passing scores on the appropriate CSET examinations, the U.S. Constitution requirement (verified by coursework or exam) and a Certificate of Clearance. Students are urged to maintain regular contact with their program advisor as the CCTC credential requirements are subject to change. Graduate students may complete a Master of Science degree in Education in conjunction with the preliminary teacher preparation coursework.",

This broad focus of perspectives allows the student to reflect critically on human nature and society and to explore chosen themes such as the character of American culture or women's issues from a variety of intellectual angles, and to do so in depth and with rigor.\nThe Liberal Arts major provides a solid background for graduate work in Law, Public Administration, and most fields in the Humanities and Social Sciences.

In addition, the Business Administration Program prepares students with the foundation necessary to successfully transfer to a four-year business program. The courses in the A.A. Business Administration program focus on business fundamentals commensurate with lower division instruction while also stressing the communication and critical thinking skills necessary to succeed and advance in a business career. General Education courses contribute to the broad-based education of students which not only makes them more attractive to employers, but exposes them to the spectrum of knowledge and ideas that are the hallmark of a liberal arts education.\nUpon completion of an A.A. Degree, students may wish to pursue a B.A. degree in Business Administration, or they can choose to terminate their education. Given the current business environment, students are strongly encouraged to continue their studies for a four-year degree. Many students who complete the two-year A.A. program in Business Administration choose to transfer to the four-year B.A. program at Mount Saint Mary’s University.\nTo be accepted into the A.A. Business Administration Program, students must have a cumulative high school GPA of at least 2.5 in all university preparatory courses. SAT or ACT scores are required and will be considered during the application process. Students who have at least 12 units of previous college course work must have a minimum GPA of 2.25 in order to be considered for admission into the program.",

It is a three-year (9 semester) program of academic rigor requiring full time study throughout the curriculum. Concentration on the basic and clinical sciences is integrated with physical therapy patient/client management principles and procedures. The total educational experience of the student involves life-long learning, and the physical therapy curriculum facilitates this value throughout the student's acquisition of knowledge and development of intellectual skills, professional behaviors, cognitive abilities, and practice competencies. The program design provides early and continual integration of clinical experiences that foster maximum development of the student's clinical thought processes, and provides opportunities for mastery of the personal and skill-based competencies requisite for entry-level practice. The Physical Therapy Department is committed to providing an education that enables graduates to be generalist practitioners of the highest quality. The learning environment nurtures students to become skilled professional practitioners, possessing the skills of clinical reasoning and effective communication. Students experience and discover the person and service-oriented aspects of health care including:\n\t1.An understanding of the holistic nature of health, integrating body, mind, spirit and emotion\n\t2.An understanding of human beings, their inherent dignity, their diverse cultures, and ethnicity\n\t3.A respect for the role of compassion and communication in health and healing\n\t4.A respect for the role of mutual trust and responsibility in patient relationships\n\t5.An ethical basis for decision making.\nAs integral members of the health care team, graduates impart their knowledge and skill through competent and compassionate patient care, enlightened education, scholarly activity and research, quality consultation and a commitment to life-long learning and professional development.",

In the domain of values, six values serve as a core for the program and are based on the mission and philosophy of the University and department. These values are compassion, communication, collaboration, community, critical thinking and competence (including professionalism).\nSeven themes serve as the conceptual framework around which the curriculum is organized. They are Foundational and Basic Sciences, Medical Sciences, Critical Thinking/Research, Patient/Client Management, Practice Management, Integration Seminar, and Clinical Experiences. The program design incorporates the presentation of foundational sciences prior to clinical application; the appreciation of \"normal\" prior to learning \"pathological;\" a hierarchical organization that progresses content and process presentation from simple material to more complex content and skill application, and from the cognitive processing domains of knowledge and comprehension to application, analysis, synthesis and evaluation. There is also an interweaving of progressively more complex clinical experiences with didactic learning within and outside of the classroom environment; and a consistent integration of learning (current and prior) through intentional learning activities and experiences. The program includes a total of 38 weeks of clinical experiences, culminating with two 12- week clinical internships.\n"

This program prepares teachers to work with students in elementary (typically K-6) classrooms in California schools. Students begin the program with prerequisite courses in foundational areas such as development, culture, and language acquisition. They complete four professional preparation courses that include early fieldwork in exemplary teachers’ classrooms in Mount Saint Mary’s University associated schools. Students finish the program with supervised teaching and a culminating seminar.  Supervised teaching may be completed in the student’s own classroom (interns and private school teachers) or in classrooms in Mount Saint Mary’s University associated schools (undergraduates and pre-service graduate students). Coursework and fieldwork provide the essential knowledge and skills students need to pass the state-mandated California Teacher Performance Assessment and the Reading Instruction Competence Assessment (RICA). Additional requirements for a teaching credential include passing scores on the Multiple Subjects CSET examinations, the U.S. Constitution requirement (verified by coursework or exam) and a Certificate of Clearance. Upon successful completion of all requirements, students apply for the Preliminary Multiple Subject Teaching Credential. Students are urged to maintain regular contact with their education program advisor as the CCTC credential requirements are subject to change. Graduate students may complete a Master of Science degree in Education in conjunction with the preliminary teacher preparation coursework.",

The MBA Program is highly student-centered, career-relevant and strategically focused on the practice of managerial leadership. The Program is distinguished by its cutting edge curriculum that recognizes that organizational leaders do not deal with a single issue in an isolated, sequential and orderly fashion. Rather, managers deal with a multitude of issues simultaneously, in pieces, in an incomplete and erratic order. The Core Curriculum encompasses 4 academically rigorous semesters of theme-based modules. For those who were not undergraduate business majors, an additional semester of “Foundations” courses are required prior to commencing the Core Curriculum. Modules are presented in a sequential manner based on the expectation that students will proceed through the curriculum as a group or cohort.",
