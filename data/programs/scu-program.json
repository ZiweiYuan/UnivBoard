Students learn how individual neurons produce and process electrochemical signals required for cellular communication (cellular and molecular neuroscience). Students study neural circuits that process sensory information from the environment and produce motor behavior and other adaptive output (systems neuroscience). Students study thought, emotion, and behavior by looking at the structure and function of brains in normal and diseased states (behavioral and cognitive neuroscience). Majoring in neuroscience prepares students for graduate work and careers in a variety of fields that seek to better understand and impact the nervous system, cognition, and mental health.",
