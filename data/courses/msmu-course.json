It is the introductory professional preparation course for the Elementary Teacher Preparation Program. Using an interactive and collaborative format, teacher candidates will examine current theory and discuss and practice ways to create positive learning environments for all children, including those learning English. Candidates will learn to use a variety of teaching strategies that support multiple learning styles, different lesson plan formats, and to self-asses their teaching practice. Candidates will also examine their own life experiences and how they influence their teaching philosophy. Candidates will have an opportunity to expand their teaching and management skills through focused observations and participation in an MSMU Teacher Center classroom where the educators are familiar with current instructional theory and practice. If the candidate is already teaching, he/she will also learn ways to look more deeply at his/her own practices. Course meetings will model and utilize effective learning techniques as wells as subject-specific pedagogy for teaching Physical Education and Health in relation to the California Content Standards and Frameworks. The course goal is to extend candidates' abilities to make decisions that are appropriate for a diverse student population where many are just learning English. Note: On-site school observations require weekly visits of 1-2 hours during the instructional day  as well as travel time to and from the fieldwork site. Candidates must have access to transportation to the fieldwork site.(Starting Fall 2012 - Requires concurrent enrollment with EDU 207 and EDU 208A) (Often cross-listed with EDU 150) (Submission of Certificate of Clearance is required for eligibility to complete this course due to the fieldwork component.)",

Its purpose is to prepare responsible citizens, parents, community members, and future teachers to use analytical skills to advocate for high-quality instruction in their local schools. Focusing on the time period between European exploration and the beginning of the 20th century, students will analyze the themes and supporting details provided in social studies/history textbooks produced for California’s fifth grade classrooms. Course participants will evaluate the historical view provided and consider the potential consequences for individuals, communities, and the nation. Topics investigated include European exploration, settlement, westward movement, Colonial rule, African slavery, the War for Independence, the Civil War, Reconstruction, and patterns of immigration and migration, among others. This course, while designed for future educators, provides perspectives useful for anyone who cares about how children are taught in United States’ schools, including parents, siblings, and community advocates.

Students who wish to pursue credit for PLA must identify the MSMU course that matches their learning and for which they’d like to earn PLA credit.  The student then enrolls in the Council for Adult and Experiential Learning’s CAEL 99 course to develop any PLA portfolios to submit for evaluation. The CAEL 99 course is a 3 unit elective credit/non-credit course at MSMU.  If credit is awarded for CAEL 99 and/or any PLA portfolios, CAEL will send an official assessment transcript directly to the MSMU Registrar’s Office. Credit obtained through PLA will be noted as such on the student’s official MSMU transcript. The University may grant up to 12 general elective units for Prior Learning Assessment. PLA units may not be used to fulfill general education requirements.  No grades will be awarded for this credit.",

The Honors Capstone course ordinarily should be taken in the students’ sophomore or junior year, though it may be done during the senior year in some circumstances. In alignment with Mount Saint Mary’s University’s Mission Statement, the Honors Capstone is designed to build upon our Honors Scholars' academic and leadership skills as a means to foster the Mount’s spirit to serve by responding to current issues our local and global communities are facing. During this course, Honors Scholars will collectively select an issue or topic to explore and execute a project from start to finish as a means to incorporate a service learning component to increase awareness and or influence change. Upon the completion of the Honors Capstone, students will be working towards submitting proposals for consideration into the Mount Academic Symposium.",

These courses must be taken consecutively. The Honors Thesis course ordinarily should be taken in the students’ senior year, though it may be done sooner in some circumstances. The Honors Thesis will allow students to use their accumulated skills and knowledge to execute an individual original research study or produce an original creative piece from an interdisciplinary perspective. The execution of the Honors Thesis will vary dependent on the students’ academic preference in collaboration under the mentorship and supervision of faculty readers. Upon the completion of the Honors Thesis, students present their Honors Thesis to the greater University community in an oral presentation format during the Mount Academic Symposium. Honors Scholars have opportunities to access academic support, travel accommodations, and conference registration to present their Honors Theses at the Western Regional Honors Council (WRHC) Annual Conference, National Collegiate Honors Council (NCHC) Annual Conference, or other professional conferences, individually or alongside faculty, as funding permits. In addition to the work designated towards the Honors Thesis, this course will prepare students for their transition out of Mount Saint Mary’s University through leadership and professional skill building, graduate school/career preparation, etc.",
