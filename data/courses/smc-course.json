A sort of ur-knowledge or ur-science, mythology in Asian societies is both an attempt to understand the nature of the cosmos and a human being's place in it as well as a means of organizing relationships among people to form a cohesive, functioning society. The course takes a thematic approach to myths and legends from a variety of sources, especially literature and the visual arts, to examine humanity's attempt to explain the unknown and the meaning of life: the beginning of the world, creation of living creatures, explanation of natural phenomena, relationships between gods and mortals, deeds of super heroes, duties of an individual in a society, death, and afterlife.

Sedimentary rocks are studied for stratigraphic relationships, environmental indicators, and biologic significance to reconstruct the geological and biological evolution of Earth over time. Numerical methods, like geochronology, are also employed to assign absolute ages to past environments. The combination of both relative and numerical methods to the study of plate tectonics and geologic structures will allow the student to understand how Earth history is reconstructed. A particular emphasis is placed on the study of North American sequences.",

In addition, the course will explore potential avenues to effectively reshape human kind's social, technological and economic relationship with its environment. As such, a systems approach will be taken that considers the human as a part of, as well as an influence on, ecosystems.
