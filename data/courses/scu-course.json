        "description": "This class will introduce students to legal technology and issues around innovation in legal practices and services. Artificial intelligence, big data analytics and blockchain/virtual currencies are already starting to emerge and be integrated with legal products. Simultaneously, economic pressure from clients and the growing gap in access to justice has led firms and legal service organizations to embrace methods of increasing efficiency, whether it is using more technology, turning to project management systems to reorganize workflows and relying less on 'the billable hour' to measure client billing and attorney performance. Through a combination of class discussion, guest lectures and interviews, exercises and a final paper, this course will provide an opportunity to students to understand the role that legal technology and new practice models of the business of law in changing the practice of law, and teach them how to consider, evaluate and adapt to emerging changes in law practice with a thoughtful and critical mindset.",

Four weeks of the course will involve reading and discussing scholarship about the Court Ce.g, the certiorari process, the selection of Justices, and how the Court decides cases. Ten weeks of the course will be devoted to the oral argument and decision of cases on the Court's current docket. At each such class meeting, some students will act as attorneys in the case and present oral arguments. The remaining students will act as justices, questioning the attorneys during argument and then meeting in conference to decide the case. For each case, at least two students will write opinions, which will subsequently be circulated, to the entire class for discussion. By the end of the semester, each student will argue at least one case and write two opinions. For these ten class meetings, every student will be required to read the actual briefs that have been filed with the Supreme Court, as well as some of the important precedent cases. Consequently, this course requires more reading than the average law school class. In addition, students' written opinions will be reviewed and discussed by their peers. Students uncomfortable with either of these aspects of the class should consider other courses. Grading will be based on in order of importanceCstudents' written opinions, their oral arguments, and their general class participation. Prerequisite: 200 Constitutional Law I.",

Topics covered will include proving discrimination, discriminatory advertising, the meaning of race under the 1866 Civil Rights Act, the meaning of \u201chandicap\u201d under the Fair Housing Act, accommodation of persons with disabilities, and discrimination to achieve integration. Discrimination in lending, sexual harassment, marital status discrimination, and claims that enforcement of certain fair housing provisions violates the free exercise rights of landlords may also be covered.",

A new concept has emerged in this period-globalization-which some argue is an accurate way to describe the massive changes underway in the international economy. Others disagree, arguing that the more things change the more they remain the same-that today's issues among nations continue to reflect longstanding differences. The debate is not simply academic but goes to the heart of policy choices being made by millions of people in every region of the globe. The questions raised by globalization are particularly acute for those countries attempting to break away from older state-centered patterns of political and economic organization. From the former Yugoslavia and the former Soviet Union to many of the developing countries of Latin America, the Middle East and Asia efforts are underway to support new ways of doing business that look, on the surface at least, like American-style capitalism. But the legal institutions necessary to make this effort a success are, as yet, immature and underdeveloped. The risks and uncertainties that this process entails are complicated but represent an exciting challenge for legal scholars and policy makers. This seminar will discuss the major points of view in the globalization debate and explore the role that law plays in solving the problems raised by the new era. Each semester we concentrate on one particular issue- set of significance, such as corporate governance or international labor issues.Students will read both theory and examine case studies.

The course should be taken by anybody who plans to make environmental or energy law the focus of their career as well as anybody with plans for a general business law practices (since the issues and skills covered in the course will arise in those general business law practice settings). The course objectives are to: 1) familiarize students in-depth and with a relatively narrow focus on a select set of the most common environmental law practice issues that private firm and government lawyers deal with, 2) teach particular skills, such as client counseling, negotiation or drafting of a complaint or a comment letter, utilized by practitioners to address those issues, and 3) directly expose students to practitioners in the field. The course is not a replacement for taking the environmental protection law survey course, but should be taken ideally concurrently with or after the environmental law survey course. However, environmental law is not a prerequisite. ",

The primary goal of the course is to provide prospective attorneys with the foundational and contextual knowledge that they will need in order to successfully recognize and evaluate the dynamics of conflict in a particular client's situation. Only upon such strong underpinnings can an attorney hope to effectively construct sound and appropriate resolution strategies. Because the ultimate practice goal, once theory is mastered, is indeed the employment of appropriate conflict resolution strategies as part of effective client representation, students in this course will also be introduced to a variety of specific conflict resolution strategies, skills and processes. Awareness of their options will help students to make informed decisions about their future law school course selections and continuing education after graduation in this field of study. In addition to lecture and assigned reading, this course will use brief exercises and group discussions to clarify and reinforce theoretical points and to provide experiential learning and skills development opportunities.",

The United States emerged from the war as the premiere global superpower in terms of combined military, diplomatic, and financial supremacy. However, the United States found itself under increased scrutiny due to its history and maintenance of structural or institutionalized racism. In the midst of military and ideological conflict against the Nazi regime in Germany, and addressing the claims of civil rights and anti-colonial activists, the United States became a composite site of the tensions that defined a democratic society struggling with ongoing racism. This reading seminar explores these tensions, which were exacerbated by the rise of anti-racist perspectives in the anthropological and biological sciences just preceding the war. The assigned readings and discussions engage these phenomena in order to properly explore the significance of \"race\" in the World War II era. Also listed as HIST 178. (5 units)",

Environmental justice as a principle affirms the right of all people to healthy livable communities. Environmental injustice occurs when environmental benefits and burdens are unevenly distributed along the lines of identity, including race, class, and/or nationality. Food justice research addresses inequalities in food access and studies the patterns, causes, and solutions associated with increasing hunger and obesity among eaters and the accumulation of environmental costs in agricultural landscapes. After reviewing several seminal studies in environmental and food justice, this class delves into case studies in California and Central America.

        "description": "Between 1789 and 1804, the French Caribbean colony of Saint-Domingue was the site of the most profound and violent realization of the revolutionary spirit sweeping the Atlantic in the \"age of democratic revolutions.\" This era is usually associated with the French and American revolutions, both key events in the history of democracy and the rhetorical development of human rights as an agenda in the West. However, both stopped short of the most radical realization of the promises of the age of Enlightenment, particularly with regard to slavery and the racial discrimination that went along with it. The slave revolt on Saint-Domingue and the Haitian revolution, by contrast, witnessed the fullest realization of these promises in the form of the only successful slave revolt in human history. The events on Hispaniola took place at the nexus of world historical forces of globalization through commerce, cross-cultural encounter, racial mixing, and the dispersal of radical Enlightenment ideas and their realization in the form of revolution. As a result of the powerful currents of human history that flowed through the region, the Haitian revolution has proved to be an enduring source of both fear and creativity in the history of race relations, slavery, and abolition, and the forging of a new world identity for the descendants of the once enslaved populations of the island. This course will examine the history of the revolutionary years in Haiti, its near erasure from Western historical memory, and the literary and historical recovery of its importance in the 20th and 21st centuries.

        "description": "This course will look at the history of immigration to the territory that makes up the United States of America. From the 18th century to events in the modern United States, we will explore the forces driving immigration and the process of acculturation in the United States. Varied case studies provide a starting point to better understand forced migration from Africa, 18th- and 19th-century immigration from Europe, migrant communities from Asia, and 20th- and 21st-century migrations from the Americas into the United States. Beyond understanding the factors driving immigration and the experiences of immigrant communities, this course explores the reception of migrants based on the influence of categories like race, gender, and religion. This class will ground you in the history and politics of immigration within the United States, but also will provide opportunities to reflect on the current debates around immigration, refugees, and other relevant contemporary issues.

Both figures&apos lives and activism are situated within the black freedom movement of the 20th century, which was both transnational and global.

Key historical questions we will explore include: Who is a citizen and what defines him or her as a citizen? On what grounds were rights granted to citizens? How were gender and race defined, and how did those definitions determine the meaning of citizen? How did disenfranchised groups argue for their rights, and in what situations were their claims successful? Also listed as WGST 169. (5 units)",

What strains and opportunities does war place upon democratic societies? Does modern patriotism enable or distort the aspirations of free societies? What forces propel individuals to assist or resist modern war making? This course encourages students to think of war as not an activity solely directed by generals and politicians, but rather a social and cultural event that is formed and negotiated by citizens, workers, and parents. This course places the World War I battlefront in the context of British imperial history, and especially examines how four years of fighting shaped Britain&aposs modern national and civic identity. Readings and materials cover the significance of the home front in many forms including the propaganda machine, the Irish problem, public school tradition, industrial organization and trade union activity, and the women&aposs vote campaign. Civic groups organized by peace protesters, conscientious objectors, suffragists, and striking workers will be explored alongside groups such as national service advocates, Empire leagues, Boys Scouts, and civil preparedness organizations.

The course entails a consideration of the religious exchanges, ethnic/racial transformations, travel tropes, and discourses on Pan-African identity that characterized the Back-to-Africa Movement in various locations of the Atlantic World. It will introduce students to a historiography of Black intellectuals, individuals, and groups who look to Africa as not only an ancestral homeland, but as a site of Christian evangelization, trade, pursuit of freedom and happiness, as well as social justice.

We shall examine their ideals of liberty, equality and justice and their attacks on war, colonialism, slavery, the death penalty, intolerance, and religious fanaticism. We will seek to discover the relationship between our societies and their legacy as that legacy had a global impact---inspiring the American and French Revolution. Readings of representative novels, short stories, \"discours,\" letters and plays, and study of artworks in their cultural (political, social, historical) contexts. (5 units)",

In particular, students will learn about important events in Turkey&aposs history (from the 19th-century Ottoman Empire to Turkey&aposs emergence as a modern nation state), colonial rule in Africa, and Japan&aposs modernization over the last 150 years. While minority communities and authors introduced in the first quarter will be revisited in the second, each quarter will have its own distinct texts.

        "description": "Italy, geographically situated at the crossroads between Europe, Asia, and Africa, has long been considered foundational for an understanding of Western culture. In this course, we will investigate Italy as a syncretic melting pot for ancient, medieval, early modern, and contemporary ideas and practices from the Mediterranean and beyond; and as a productive cultural site responsible for, itself, shaping ideas and practices in Europe, the \"New World,\" and beyond to the present day. In the first of this two-course sequence, we will focus on: (1) Medieval Italy as an important locus of syncretism with an emphasis on the Mediterranean and the movement of political, culinary, and cultural ideas from east to west and south to north; and (2) Renaissance Italy, the primary features of the Italian Renaissance and its artistic, cultural, and scientific influence on Western culture. During the second quarter, we will extend our examination of syncretism to 19th-century Italy, a country struggling with a definition of incomplete nationhood even beyond Unification in 1861. Finally, we will explore how 20th and 21st century Italy, through its changing political role, difficult marriage with the Church, and waves of migrations (specifically emigration to the United States, and recent immigration to Italy) has returned to question its relationship to global culture. Course is taught in English and therefore does not satisfy the Core second language requirement. (4 units each quarter)",

But, what if Jesus was black, non-white Latino/a, Amerindian, Asian, or Jewish? And, why is contemporary scholarship still grappling with the idea of Jewish messiah? In order to map the politics of interpretation and presentation, the course seeks to \"radicalize\" Jesus by (1) exploring his Jewishness in terms of race and ethnicity; (2) critically engaging sources from the New Testament, Apocryphal narratives, Rabbinic literature, and the Quran; (3) interrogation of the racial/racist reconstructions of Western biblical scholarship; and (4) mapping the implications for marginalized ethnic communities and interracial dialogue. Key themes to explore include: Race/ethnicity, Colonialism and Imperialism, the quests for Historical Jesus, Hitler&aposs Third Reich, Eugenics, Interreligious Dialogue, police violence (Ferguson & Baltimore), and the polemic over Jesus&apos wife.

From the 1970s to the 2000s, religion-based forms of healing moved from being considered \"alternative\" to \"integrative\" medicine by the medical establishment.

With abundant transnational business, treaties, and marriages, the selecting process is complicated by various local and global relations formed in the past to present.

We will wrestle with questions such as: Is citizenship an individual or collective matter? Is citizenship a universal concept? Is it useful? What does it mean to be a citizen in various Asian nations? You will work on a project on how citizenship is communicated in a nation state of your interest. (5 units)",

The course uses three distinct but related activities to achieve this goal. Nationally renowned business, military, and civic leaders share the experiences and challenges that shaped them, their careers, and major decisions. The goal of having iconic leaders share with honesty and vulnerability is to inspire students to do the same in the course and their lives. Harvard Business School cases give students the opportunity to learn from the most critical business and policy decisions of our times. Putting students in the role of decision-maker challenges them to understand the complexity of decision making and leadership, and begins to train them for their careers post SCU. Leadership Development Teams (LDTs) are small mentored groups. The goal is for students to explore and share their authentic selves and develop the courage to live as their authentic selves in their careers and lives. Note: We seek evidence of a student&aposs ambition to make an impact and the hunger and maturity to pursue the journey of self-awareness, authenticity, and courageous action. (5 units)",

While some argue that globalization has eliminated differences between nations and made the world one large market so that, as one journalist asserts, the \"world is flat,\" this course will show that the reality is far more complicated. To deal with this complexity, firms, first, require leaders who are sensitive to and can bridge differences in culture and systems of government and, second, must innovate in new ways that leverage differences in economics and culture.

Broadly defined, these technologies include software tools and applications that leverage social activity within an online platform to facilitate interaction and collaboration among members of an online community and between members of a community and a firm. As such, they help firms engage the creativity and problem solving skills of firm-hosted online communities of users, employees, and other experts in the creation, development and refinement of products or services. As a result, their use may yield innovations that strongly fit user preferences while also, accelerating the pace and lowering the cost of product innovation. Despite the rapid adoption, many firms struggle with how to create value from CT-based co-innovation. Building on literature on user innovation, open innovation, and demand side value creation, this course explores the conditions for creating value when engaging online communities in co-innovation. The content focuses on non-open source contexts and community engagements that yield private gains for a host firm.

Yet many Silicon Valley marketers rely only on technology, attributes and/or price and overlook the strategic and tactical benefits that a well-managed brand provides. Achieving Brand Leadership provides a framework and tools for marketers to successfully brand products and services and add an additional layer of advantage with in the competitive environment. The course defines and examines the concept of branding through a theoretical and conceptual framework and in number of business contexts. Beginning with a fundamental review of the core branding elements, we weigh the importance of both the promise and the experience aspects of branding in building and sustaining trust. An examination of brand measurements illuminates the power of metrics and highlights different aspects of branding strategies. A look at past cases of successful and unsuccessful branding brings out variations in approaches to such issues as master brands, sub-brands, and the branding of services. Finally, the impact of branding architectures and creative positioning on brand equity are considered. The course will use both management readings and current articles to provide a solid foundation for analysis. A series of cases drawn from both the product and service arenas will enable students to apply this analytical framework to actual situations. Brand equity and its related metrics provide a standard basis in evaluating various strategies for establishing and growing brands. A final individual course project offers an opportunity to integrate various facets of branding for a specific product or service. Prerequisite: MKTG 3552. (2 units)",

        "description": "These course prepare students for the career transitions that they will encounter once completing Santa Clara University&aposs MBA program. These highly relevant courses concentrate on the skills students require to succeed early on in their careers. These lessons learned will be applicable to transitions throughout the students&apos careers. The courses are based on critical transitions, formative experiences, and personal conflict that characterize the common challenges MBAs are likely to face as they progress in their careers. One objective is to help students gain a more robust understanding of some of the pitfalls they may encounter as they make transitions within or across organizations. Research demonstrates that career failures are often associated with individual failures to successfully make these transitions. Blending theory and practice sessions will illustrate the lessons learned by others (such as SV executives) that have sometimes stumbled in making what seem to be straightforward transitions. Why are transitions challenging? Typically transitions require learning new skills and strategies for managing people who have different responsibilities, needs, goals and expectations than the individual has led in the past. For example, the role as individual team member vs. managing a team requires a shift in mindset from getting a job done through personal skills and effort to getting work done through others; shifting from a manager to a leader requires a shift in attention from focusing on doing things right to doing the right things. Such transitions often mean letting go of the very things that have made us successful in the past and deriving satisfaction from others&apos accomplishments. Although easy to understand conceptually, this marks a fundamental shift in individuals&apos identities. Prerequisite: All core courses. Must be taken in last quarter of residence. (1 unit)",

Regenerative medicine is a new branch of medicine that attempts to change the course of chronic disease, in many instances regenerating failing organ systems lost due to age, disease, damage, or congenital defects. The area is rapidly becoming one of the most promising treatment options for patients suffering from tissue failure. This course covers principles and real cases of stem cell and regenerative medicine. Its major applications will be discussed in a comparative fashion to better understand the advantages/disadvantages of each system.
