By applying course material to their experience, students develop a deeper understanding of the discipline."

An evolutionary perspective will be employed to identify the pathways by which the clash of a \"universal human nature\" and the modern environment results in an \"evolutionary mismatch.\" Evolutionary models such as the \"tragedy of the commons\" will be elucidated with relevant and real world examples. In addition, the course will explore potential avenues to effectively reshape human kind's social, technological and economic relationship with its environment. As such, a systems approach will be taken that considers the human as a part of, as well as an influence on, ecosystems. Cutting edge research will be integrated from different domains of psychology (cognitive, social, developmental and evolutionary, etc.) as well as related fields (genetics, behavioral economics, game-theory, anthropology, etc.) to comprehensively study the human-environment interaction."
